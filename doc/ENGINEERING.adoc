== TODOs
. Consider a configurable template hierarchy for organization
.. How many levels
.. Require top level
.. Searchable by node name

Rather than doing below, top level could hold a list.

----
class Node {
    Node(Node parent, name, description) {
    }

    int get level => _parent.level

    int addChild(Node child)

    void remove() {
        parent.child = child
    }
}
