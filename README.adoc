== Overview ==
Deliberate Practice, Deliberate Action
....Refine your mental models....

I am a software developer. This project was initially motivated by the Agile practice of _Retrospectives_,
known in other arenas as After Action Reviews, After Action Debriefings, Post Mortems and more. For
the unitiated, retrospectives are done at the end of a software development cycle called a sprint or
iteration. It, in turn, seems to have been inspired the military After Action Review process. You reflect
upon what was done so that you and your team could improve their practice. I am leaving much out here, of
course. I became somewhat frustrated for people, including myself, did not remember many details. I felt
the level of learning I hoped for was just not there. Except for the biggest problems, there just was not
enough detail. I decided it was wise to capture and reflect in much smaller chunks of time. _Reflecting on
what you have just done seems to be a proven strategy, one that has application well beyond the realm of
software development_.

In the early days of Agile, you would often hear an argument about whether software development is an
art or a craft. In my opinion, it is neither. It seems to me to more closely resemble a learning activity,
one that is closer to scientific experimentation. You have a hypothesis of how something should work,
you build a test apparatus, and you test the hypotheses. Okay - so not a perfect analogy.

Listening to colleagues during the midst of a project, or even something as small as a story or task, you
will often hear them talk of what they learned. I believe this is true of many activities. *We are always
learning.* This tool helps to focus that learning.

This tool attempts to incorporate deliberate practice with any learning activity. It creates a feedback loop
for learning and practice sessions. Thinking about what you could have done better is the part of the deliberative
process. The other is having that fresh in your mind as you begin in your next session. Over time, it should be
possible to see patterns.

While I don't know if there is great evidence supporting the Pomodoro like short iterations and breaks, it
feels right. Perhaps that is the software engineer in me for I believe things should be kept as simple as
possible. Planning activities that are of short duration should help foster a laser like focus on what
can be achieved, keeping them simple, understandable, unsurprising. And, importantly, easy to reflect
upon. The book _Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise_ does reinforce the concept of short sessions
followed by reviews and that book seems to be fairly research laden. So, a good thing.

Each of these short sessions are followed by an After Action Report - using the military lingo. They allow you to consider what happened, what you want to reinforce and what you can do
to improve. This is the reflection activity. The four parts of an AAR are:

. Review what was supposed to happen (the plan).
. Establish what actually happened.
. Determine what went right and what went wrong.
. Determine how the task could be performed differently in the future.

The tool, however, is not destined to be prescriptive. The questions should be customizable to fit the needs of
the individual and the situation. Guides and templates will be included to help individuals with their own needs.

I have many further thoughts about how this should eventually work and look. But, for now, *I am trying to
keep it simple so that I may _learn_, _reflect_ and modify my _practice_.*

This talks about using the tool Notability (and/or Notion?) for taking notes during lectures, for projects, etc. This is a different a
definitely different tool than what I see of the Roam Research tool (mentioned elsewhere). Like it, I feel this has
features that could be integrated in a future version of this tool.

The Roam Research tool seems particularly apt for research. It, has some interesting features that may have applicability
in this tool.

== Getting Started
. Not yet defined

== Considerations For Future Releases ==
. A goal setting template? How would that work?
. Works on multiple platforms:
.. Works on both smart phones and web pages.
.. Data updated on one device is immediately propogated to all devices.
. Provides an implementation of related task (activity) and time management practices:
.. Pomodoro planning
.. Urgent/Important matrix - (Eisenhower & Covey)
.. After action report
.. Time Tracking
.. Incorporates knowledge of Chronotypes
. Activities that
.. Contain zero or more sub-activites
.. Time recording at any level
. Configurable:
.. Pomodoro interval lengths
.. Features used in activity
.. Activities can be scheduled with specific start/stop times, complete with alarms.
.. Templates exist to quickly setup various types of activities.
... Workday templates, for example, could have time allotted to recurring/regular activities.
. Integrate with google calendars
. Allows for planning and tracking of many sessions of a given type (templated)
. Allows for multiple people to work/share an activity
. Allows for reporting of various types
